Code that can be used to reproduce main findings in the article "On weighted ensembles of streamflow: bias correct separately and prefer constrained weights for more reliable and predictable outputs".

The code at the moment is still relatively uncommented. More comments and explanation forthcoming. 

To run the code, you'll need to download:
* CARAVAN dataset (https://zenodo.org/records/7944025) 
* Regionalised HBV parameters (https://www.gloh2o.org/hbv/)
